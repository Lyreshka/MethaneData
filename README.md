## Library(MethaneData)

This library was created for the use of the following app <https://lyreshka.shinyapps.io/MethaneFluxDataExplorer/>


## Datasets Used and Acknowledgements

This library uses multiple datasets related to methane fluxes:

## Open and Reproducible Science

All datasets are publicly accessible via PANGAEA and acknowledged with proper citations. The app processes these data through the `MethaneData` package, ensuring an open and reproducible workflow.
